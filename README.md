# ELIZA-AndroidApp
An Android-App for Adaptation of ELIZA talking system in Hindi


One implementation of the Android App for English Eliza is added to this repository. The complete Eliza python code is implemented in java, which can be used for developing the Android App.

Another implementation is added which uses nltk interface.

There are some implementations available online which is deprecated now. So, I haven't added them to this repository.
