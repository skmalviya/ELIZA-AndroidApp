# ELIZA-AndroidApp
ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. It was Created to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between humans and machines. Eliza simulated conversation by using a pattern matching and substitution methodology to produce surprisingly life-like responses. It is a simulation of a psychotherapist in an initial psychiatric interview.

Input sentences are analyzed on the basis of decomposition rules which are triggered by key words appearing in the input text. Responses are generated by reassembly rules associated with selected decomposition rules.

In this project, We developed a complete speech enabled  chatbot where the user will interact with the chatbot in Hindi language. 

One implementation of the Android App for English Eliza is added to this repository. The complete Eliza python code is implemented in java, which can be used for developing the Android App.

The Java Code for Hindi Adaption of Eliza Chatbot can be found at MainActivity.java

The Script used for Hindi Adaption of Eliza is also added for reference. 

The Hindi Eliza Application is a complete speech-to-speech enabled system where the user can have a conversation with the Eliza Chatbot.
